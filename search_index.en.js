Here I want to share things about me that can \nhelp you to understand better what kind of professional I am.\nEducation\nAfter completing high school, I studied Computer Engineering. A few years later, I felt like diving deeper into Math. \nI figured it could give me a better understanding of the most complex parts of the software development world. \nSo, I signed up for a Bachelor of Mathematics at a distance learning university. Not entirely sure if I'm using the right English \nterms here, so I've stuck with the Spanish names.\n\nIngeniero Superior en Informática (Computer Engineer) - Universidad de Deusto\nLicenciado en Matemáticas (Bachelor of Mathematics) - 60% of credits passed, not finished - U.N.E.D.\n\nCompanies\nI consider myself very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work for fantastic companies over the years. \nI even co-founded one with my great friend \nElena, \nwhere I dedicated more than 10 years of my career. \nI treasure the memories of each of them, the valuable experiences I gained, and the colleagues I had the pleasure of \nworking with. I learned from them and always tried to leave a positive impression. \nFor several years now, I am part of Clarity AI, a great place to work with amazing teammates. \nI work there as a Tech Lead in the Data Engineering Guild.\n\nTech stuff\nIn a professional setting, I've worked with many languages, cloud vendors, database engines, libraries, frameworks, \nbig data tools, and services. However, I don't believe it's worth trying to mention them.\nI firmly believe that, in general, it is not worth becoming an expert in specific technologies. Personally, \nI am not a fan of technical certifications (even I have a few) because in our world technologies come and go. \n\nIt amazes me how much time we spend learning new technology and how little we spend improving our mastery and \nunderstanding of the principles and patterns that will make our software strong - Rafael Gómez Blanes\n\nThat's why I've never minded transitioning from one technology to another, nor do I worry about having to continue \ndoing so in the future.\nIf you are curious about my current stack, you can check the Clarity AI Data Platform stack here.\nBooks\nI love reading books and I want to highlight those that I have read related to my profession, not to brag, but\nbecause they have helped me become the Software Developer and Tech Lead I am today.\nI'm constantly on the lookout for new recommendations, so feel free to share any suggestions you may have!\nLeadership, culture\n\nDon't make me think - Steve Krug\nEngineering Management for the Rest of Us - Sarah Drasner  👉 read my review!!\nIt doesn't have to be crazy at work - Jason Fried, David H.

Entendiéndolo como el hecho de esforzarse al \nmáximo, asegurar que siempre estamos permanentemente ocupados haciendo cosas e incluso yendo más allá de lo \nnecesario metiendo las horas extra que haga falta. ¿Quién no querría un equipo formado por personas que trabajan \nasí? Pues si lo que queremos hacer es Software de calidad y que aporte valor, tal vez trabajar así no sea la mejor idea.\nCreo en la Ingeniería de Software como un trabajo intelectual y creativo que se realiza en colaboración \ncon personas, en un entorno en constante cambio. En esta charla, exploraremos el principio de \"Work Smarter, \nNot Harder\" aplicado al desarrollo de software. Explicaré por qué creo que el trabajo duro puede afectar \nnegativamente no sólo a los desarrolladores, sino también a la calidad del software que producen.

Understanding it as the act of putting in maximum\neffort, ensuring that we are always permanently busy doing things, and even going beyond what is necessary by \nputting in overtime. Who wouldn’t want a team made up of people who work like that? Well, if what we want to\ndo is quality software that adds value, maybe working like that is not the best idea.\nI believe in Software Engineering as an intellectual and creative job that is done in collaboration with people, \nin a constantly changing environment. In this talk, we will explore the principle of “Work Smarter, Not Harder”\napplied to software development. I will explain why I believe that hard work can negatively affect not only developers \nbut also the quality of the software they produce. I will also share ideas and strategies that have worked for me and\nmy teams, always with the goal of generating quality software that adds value.\n","id":"https://mikelors.com/posts/bilbostack25presentingtopic/","title":"Estaré en la Previa de la Bilbostack'25"},"https://mikelors.com/posts/bookreviewaccelerate/":{"body":"Lean methodologies, DevOps, small cycles, CI/CD, no overtime, freedom, quality, culture, sustainable work… cool stuff.\nA lot of people talk about them in positive terms but Nicole Forsgrem, Jez Humble and Gene Kim decided to go one \nstep further: demonstrate that these things work.\n\nTo do this they dedicated 4 years of investigation to find what capabilities and practices are important to accelerate \nthe software development and delivery. 23,000 responses to surveys from around 2,000 organizations, from startups to \nlarge companies.\nIt is the only solid research I’ve found on this topic (if you know of another, I’d love to read it), and this book \nshows the results.

Because \nthere is a lot of posts and information in the net about Clean Code, I think that a new article talking about it simply \nexplaining some the principles is not going to be very worthy.\nIn this article I will try to give you a practical approach to Clean Code. I will not go deep into the theory, I want \nto show how I write Clean Code.\n\n\nI want to break free my code clean\nWhat is Clean Code and why should we care?\nOrigin and a definition\nThere are several books and experienced developers talking about clean coding in the community.\nI have built a kind of definition of Clean Code joining the opinions of several authors and sources and what I get \nis that Clean Code has these features:\n\nIt is important, at least as important as other concepts like performance, cover the functionality, avoid bugs, …\nIt is easy for any developer to read.\nIt is easy for any developer to modify.\nIt was written by someone who cares it.\nIt does what is expected. The code does not fool you, no surprises.\n\nWhy you should write clean code\nI really believe that writing Clean Code is important because it’s the first step to cover the main goal of any \narchitecture: minimize the human effort needed to create and maintain the required system.\nWhen we are coding, we use to spend more time (much more time) reading code than writing. We read legacy code, \nlibraries code, your team mates code, code written by you several months ago (that you don’t remember), code written by \nsomeone who left the company, code in Stack Overflow…\n\n\"Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1\"\n\nTaking this in consideration, is not it worth a little extra writing effort? You will get back several times the extra \ntime you spend cleaning your code. Think about it the next time you are going to commit a piece of code.\nLast thought about why we should care our code is that we, the developers, do not write code solely to be interpreted \nby machines. We write code to be read by humans. Let's think that we are authors, in the same way that a journalist \nwrites in a newspaper or a writer creates a novel.\nSome principles\nThere are many principles and ideas about what is clean and what is not. You can find them on the net. But because I need \nsome basic principles to have something to play with, I am going to introduce some of them. If you already know them \nyou can skip to the next section, if not I think they will allow you to get an idea of the style of the rest of the theory \nand, perhaps, the motivation to know more.\nSo, let's see some principles with code.\n\nLet's practice with code!\nNaming\nWe are deciding names everywhere when we are coding: variables, functions, classes, packages, files… Taking it seriously \nis a first step to having Clean Code.\nSome tips to get clean names:\n\nUse intention-revealing names:\n\n\nIf you find this \"s\" entity later you get nothing about its purpose\n\nChoose pronounceable names:\n\n\nIt's not easy to talk with a colleague about the red variable without losing face\n\nUse searchable names:\n\n\nIf you try to find the \"r\" variable with your IDE's search tool, probably you will find more than you want\n\nAvoid prefixes and suffixes and abbreviations: \n\n\nWhat the hell is 'hp': hypotenuse, high point…? Spanish speakers could have more proposals.\nThere are many other tips about choosing good names. Probably use intention-revealing names is the most important but \nwhat is really important is to take the naming seriously.\nTake your time to choose good names. And don't be afraid to change an existing name if you think that the code is going \nto be more readable after the change.\nFunctions\nBetween all the ideas about clean functions I am going to highlight three for this post.\n\nFirst rule is basic and easy to remember: Functions should do one thing, they should do it well and they should do it \nonly. Not too much to explain here: avoid side effects, split your functions if you notice that they are doing several \nthings at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nFunctions should be small. Ok, but how short they should be? How to measure it? Let's force our functions to have no \nmore than 2 levels of indentation. If this is hard for you, you can start setting a higher limit (3 levels, for example), \nbut please put a limit on the levels of indentation you allow.\n\n\nRegarding the arguments… The fewer arguments a function has, the cleaner it is. Why? Arguments need a lot of context \nknowledge. In each call a reader must have context to understand each argument. More arguments→ more context you need \nto understand. Arguments are also hard from a testing point of view. More arguments, more test cases to ensure that all \nthe combinations of arguments work properly\n\n\n\nYou must have a good reason for having more than 2 arguments in a function\nComments\nWhen I learned to code in the 90's, my teachers used to ask me to write comments everywhere. It was typical to hear them \nsay things like \"If you don't comment your code, I'm not going to correct your exam…\". The goal of those comments was to \nmake our code easier to read. This is a goal that we also have when writing Clean Code, but maybe comments are not the \nbest way to achieve it.\nComments lie, and I am sure that we have all found old comments saying something outdated. Because the code is \nmaintained, but there is nothing that forces the comments to be maintained as well. Is there anything worse than \na fake comment?\nThe truth is only in the code. When you think you need to write a comment, always think if there is not a better \nway to express this using the code.\nThe most important idea is to try to avoid comments to explain the code. For example:\n\nAvoid comments to explain a variable. Instead, choose a good name for this variable and you won't need a comment\nAvoid comments to explain a function. Instead, force your function to do only one thing, have few arguments and \nchoose a good name for it and its arguments and you won't need a comment\n\nLet's see a practical case:\n\nWe have something complex. We feel that is going to be hard to understand in the future:\n\n\nWhat is happening here? Did you get it? Cool, but maybe not trivial for everyone\n\nWe can add a comment to make it easier to understand:\n\n\nI have put a comment. Now I can sleep better. But, is this the best solution?\n\nLet's try another option, let's extract the complex code to a method with a cool name:\n\n\nDefinitively now it's clean!\nThink about what a future reader will want to know when they find this if. They will be interested to know that \nthis if is checking if the year is a leap year, but probably they will not be interested in how we are getting it.\nIf they are curious, they can navigate to the implementation of this coolly named method. Unintentionally, \nby avoiding a comment we are separating different levels of abstraction in our code.\nSo, in general, avoid comments to explain code. And, because you will be using GIT or any other distributed \nversion control system, avoid commented-out code (delete it!), attributions and bylines, and this kind of stuff.\nComments are not forbidden, there are situations where comments make sense:\n\nLegal comments\nTODO comments\nAmplifications about the importance of something or the reason of a concrete decision in the code\nMandated comments (JavaDocs,...) in public APIs (but, avoid this in non-public code… don't force a team to \ncomment the all the functions of all your classes!!!)\n\nMore principles\nAs I told before, I was going to comment just a few principles to get a basic understanding of the Clean Code theory. \nSo, these are only some of the most basic ideas about Clean Code. If you find them interesting and you want to know \nmore, look for more resources on the net.\nHow to clean your code? Refactor is the key\nWell, good naming, small functions, no comment to explain the code… got it. But, how can I do it? How can I write \ncode following these ideas?\nOur job is hard in itself. Writing code and getting it to work can already be enough challenge. And that without \nworrying about leaving it clean.\n\nWriting code was already difficult without having to think about its cleanliness\nSo, the keyword here can be Refactor. A good way can be to write code without worrying too much about cleanliness, and \nlater, when we have the code doing what we want, clean it up with a refactor.\nDefinition of Refactor\nCode refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. \nIt means that the code before and after the refactor must do exactly the same.\nThings that are not refactors:\n\nChange an algorithm\nReplace one type of loop with another\nUpgrade the performance of a piece of code\n\nThings that are refactors:\n\nExtract a piece of code to a Function\nRename things\nExtract several functions to a new Class.\nCreate a constant to store a hardcoded value\n…\n\nSafe Refactoring\nMaybe you are thinking that \"I don't want to break the code, it's working fine!\". Yes, of course. It could have \nbeen quite difficult to get the code working, we don't want to break it when refactoring. And this is the typical \nreason people argue for not changing very bad code. But don't worry, there is safe way.\nWe can rely on two things to refactor without fear:\n\nRefactoring can be a joy if we have good tests and use cool Refactoring tools\n\nTesting: we should have good automated tests for our code for many reasons. But it is obvious that this is \nsomething that will help us refactor without breaking nothing. After each refactoring you can check if all the \ntests are still green. I am not going to write about testing in this post, maybe in another one in the future. \nIf you don't know about testing, you should. There is a lot of information on the net. If you don't know where to \nstart, ask me :).\n\n\nEverything is green. It seems that we haven't broken anything.\n\nRefactoring tools: modern IDEs have tools that do some of the most common refactoring actions automatically. \nIf we use them we will be reducing the possibilities of breaking something when making changes to the code. \nI am going to introduce them at the end of this post ;).\n\nWhen should you Refactor your code?\nAll the time. I mean, you should be working on development cycles of:\n\nWrite code\nWrite tests\nRefactor\n\nAnd not necessarily in this order. You can develop using TDD and, in this case, you will write your tests before the \ncode. But anyway, you should refactor each time you have a piece of working code. In other words: you should refactor \nat the end of each cycle. And these cycles should be small.\nBecause if you work inside a small iteration of development it will be very easy to refactor, to ensure that everything \nis clean, that you are not breaking things, etc… Do you usually spend several days writing to end up making a delivery \nwith a lot of lines of code in several files? Maybe not the best habit.\nAppendix: Refactoring tools\nFor this appendix I have chosen an IDE that I am comfortable with, such as \nJetBrains' IntelliJ for Java. \nBut you will be able to find these kind of tools in the IDE you use for your preferred language. If not, maybe you should \ntry another IDE.\nRename\nProbably the simplest refactoring tool is Rename. You have an entity with a name that you don't like and you want to \nchange it. Of course, you can edit it manually... but this won't be trivial because this entity can be used in a lot \nof places.\nFor example: I want to change the name of the class Input. I want to call it WordFrequency.\n\nBecause it is a Class, there are a lot of potential places where I should change Input identifier. Manually, \nI should look for all of them. But we have Rename refactoring tool:\n\nRename tool with all its options to rename an entity safely\nThis tool will rename the entity and it will be in charge of rename everything we need: other usages, the file name, \ntests… even variable names that could have relation with out entity:\n\nIt has realized that I had several variables that I might like to change. Thanks IDE!\nExtract method\nThis is probably the tool I use the most. Let's see an example:\n\nI have this piece of code that is part of a very big function that I want to refactor. I think that some \nof these lines are doing something unique that could be a private function. So I decide to extract.\n\n\nI want to extract the creation of wordFrequencyList to a method\n\nI use the extract method tool. This tool offers me several options about how the new method is going to be: \n\n\nExtract method tool even dares to propose a cool name…\n\nNow the code is extracted to a method and here we have the call. The tool will take care of creating the method, \nmoving the code and changing all the places where we had that same code with one call (because it finds duplicates).\n\n\nCleaner, isn't it?\nOther tools\nThere are many Refactoring Tools for the most common actions you can want to do to restructure your code. \nTalking about IntelliJ Idea we can take a look to the documentation about Code Refactoring or you can look for the \ndocumentation of your preferred IDE. I encourage you to discover all the Refactoring Tools in your IDE and play with\nthem to understand how they work and if you find them useful.\n\nA lot of refactoring tools!\nIn fact, in my IDE I can select a piece of code and get the \"Refactor This\" menu that will show me all the \nRefactoring Tools I can apply to this concrete case:\n\nTell me, kind IDE, what can I do with this?\nOne last argument\nThere is a final argument to clean your code if you are not completely convinced\n\nAlways code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live - \nJohn F.Woods.\n\nSome thanks\n\nTo you. If you have come this far, thank you very much for reading my post.\nTo Clarity AI Engineering Team for giving me the opportunity and the time to write this post.\nTo the great cartoonist, data science and friend \nIbai Laña for his amazing \ndrawings of zucchinis.\n\n","id":"https://mikelors.com/posts/cleancodeapracticalapproach/","title":"Clean Code — A practical approach"},"https://mikelors.com/posts/howicreatedthisblog/":{"body":"So, I finally made the decision to create my own personal website. Alright, I've purchased the domain \nmikelors.com, but what comes next?\nWhat I wanted\nI had some clear priorities for my webpage. Mainly three\n\n👷 Minimal maintenance: I'm aiming for a setup without the need for plugins or frequent updates. I have\npast experiences with CMSs like Joomla, Wordpress, Drupal... and they are cool, but require maintenance effort that I \ndon't want. \n🔐 Secure with no effort: I don't want a website that could be hacked easily and, at the same time, I don't \nwant to spend time and effort on security features. \n🤌 Self-managed: I don't want a SaaS platform like Wordpress.com, Blogger, Whatever where the owner could change\ntheir policies, change their prizes or simply ban me for any reason. \n\nThe purpose of this article is to demonstrate how I achieved this setup. \nLong story short is asking a good friend that already had a personal website that I guessed that could have \nsimilar priorities than me. \nHow it's made\nSo yes, I asked to my friend and coworker Dani Sancas (you can check his cool blog \ndanisancas.com) if his website covered my priorities and, \nno surprise, the answer was \"yes, with an SSG\". This explanation is writen by me, but the credits belong to\nDani. Thank you for your advice!\nA Static Site Generator (SSG) is a software engine \nthat generates static sites. This means generating HTML, CSS, and almost everything else needed for the site. \nThere are several options but the one Dani recommended and I used here is Zola. \nI am not going to create a tutorial about Zola, it already has a very good \ndocumentation. I will explain how it \nworks and how it covers my priorities. \nThis is everything I needed: \n\n🔒 A private Repo: This is where Zola lives. It's private, so everything here is only accessible by me. \nIt has a small CI/CD script made with Github Actions to deploy \nthe website. \n🔓 A public Repo: this is where the blog lives. The HTML and CSS you are seeing now. Using \nGithub Pages, it has a HTTPS access to be published as a website.\n🌐 A domain: I bought the nice www.mikelors.com to have my own domain.\n\n\nHow this works: \n\n✏️ I write new articles 📄 or whatever to the Private Repo. Zola works with Markdown, so it's pretty easy to write\ndocument with good format and appearance. \n⚙️ Whenever I commit changes to the Private Repo, the CI/CD process is triggered. It performs two key functions: \n\nGenerate the Static Website's Files using the Zola framework. \nUpdate the Public Repo with these Files. \n\n\n\nAnd that's it :). \nWhat I got\nHow my priorities are covered:\n\n👷 Almost zero maintenance: The website is 100% static. No dynamic elements or moving parts... I don't need \nso I don't have them. HTMLs and CSSs. Nothing to update, nothing to improve, nothing. If I wanted, I could upgrade\nthe Zola version... but only if I wanted to get new features or something. \n🔐 Secure with no effort: The hackeable code is in a private repo, closed. The public website only has HTML and CSS\n. No databases, no scripts, no files storing data, no permissions, nothing. It's only a facade.\n🤌 Self-managed: It's me and my GIT repositories. Currently hosted on Github, but if necessary, \nI can migrate them to a different GIT server with just one command. This is real self-managing 🤘\n\nSome extra cool features that were not my priorities: \n\n🧳 Easy to migrate: it's markdown. There are a lot of markdown interpreters and SSGs. I love Zola, but tomorrow I could\nmove all my articles to a different SSG or framework. \n🍪 No cookies: Did you need to push any annoying button in this website to accept/reject cookies? You did not. Nothing \nin the client's browser but HTML and CSS. No cookies, no annoying warnings or storing data for third-providers. \n🏃 Quick: I would say SUPER QUICK. The page loads super fast (95/100 performance qualification in \nPagespeed.web.dev.\n📱 Responsive and 🤙 pretty: Zola has several good templates. I checked several and decided for this cool template called \nDeepThought that I like. And I can forget everything about Responsiveness, the template does it very good. Actually I \ngot a 92/100 in RankMath\n💰 Cheap: everything is 100% free but the domain. I paid 7€ for the first year.\n\n","id":"https://mikelors.com/posts/howicreatedthisblog/","title":"How I created a self-managed blog, secure and maintainable"},"https://mikelors.com/posts/propertybasedtesting/":{"body":"What Property based tests are\nProperty based tests are a type of tests that check properties of our functions that should always be true. \nThey allow us to define a group of inputs following some rules and check that property on them in a single test.\nLet’s see how they work\nImagine that we want to test this function:\n\nThe function we want to test (implementation is not important for this article)\nThe function is going to delete the duplicates on the key_column of the df DataFrame. The point is that if \nthere is a value duplicated, it should be solved checking the priority_column. The priority_values will tell us \nthe record we should choose.\nWell, this function should have a kind of algorithm inside that will:\n\nfind all the duplicates in the key_column\ncheck the value they have in the priority_column\nchoose the one that has the highest priority value based of priority_values and drop the rest of them.\n\nI am going to use Property Based Testing to check one property that the result must cover: it shouldn’t have \nduplicates in the key_column. Never. It does not matter witch are the inputs.\nLet’s build our test!\nPrevious work: imports and definitions\nI need to import some stuff from the Hypothesis library:\n\nI will define some variables that I need:\n\nThe @given decorator\nThis decorator allows us to define random variables based on a set of rules that we write using the Hypothesis\nnotation. It’s very readable, so I guess that you will understand easily what I am defining here:\n\nBasically I have expressed how I need a random DataFrame with 2 columns, both of string type. To define how the values should be I have used regex.\nLet’s see how it works executing it directly in the Python console with the Hypothesis example() method:\n\nExample of our random DataFrame built using Hypothesis\nLet’s execute it again:\n\nAnother execution of Hipothesis code\nIn the first execution, it has generated an 8-rows DataFrame with random values based on my regex. In the \nsecond execution, a 2-row DataFrame, coincidentally being both rows equal. As you can see, each execution will \ngenerate a random variable based on our rules, with varying length and different content.\nThe test with @given decorator\nThis basic test runs our function passing the random DataFrame an checks that the result has no duplicates in the \nkey_column:\n\nWhen we execute it, the test is going to be launched 200 times with a different random variable in each execution. \nWell, it’s not really true that is exactly 200 times, you can read how many times will Hypothesis run your test \narticle to understand it better.\nWe can put a print sentence in our code to see in the console how it works:\n\nMy test with some traces for the console\nObviously I cannot show here all the output, but this last screenshot should be enough to understand the idea.\n\nLast traces in my console after launching my test\nIt is cool, isn’t it?\nWhen to use them\nThese tests are a great option to ensure a basic (or not) property. They cover a lot of edge cases because they \nare going to execute a lot of instances with random values. Each time your CI/CD runs will generate a new set of \nrandom executions.\nBut, they have some limitations. I think that property-based tests complement normal unit tests, but they don’t \nreplace them.\nFirstly because in most situations you won’t be able to define a property that is sufficient to ensure that your \ncode works. For example, we can not easily define a property to ensure that our function is choosing the right row \nin each case using the priority_values, but we have been able to define a more basic property that we know must be \nsatisfied.\nAnother limitation is that when a Property Based Test fails it is not easy to understand what is happening because \nyou need to investigate witch concrete edge case is failing. It is a very good suggestion to generate a unit test \nwith the concrete case that caused the failure.\nConclusion\nI encourage you to use them in your next development. Think about the small feature you are generating and about \nthe properties it should cover. Design easy Property Based Tests to ensure them. Tough you think you are checking \nvery simple things… Property Based Tests often surprise us.\nIf you don’t work with Python, find a library in your preferred language to develop Property Based Tests.\n","id":"https://mikelors.com/posts/propertybasedtesting/","title":"Property based testing — A practical approach in Python with Hypothesis and Pandas"},"https://mikelors.com/subscribe/":{"body":"\n\n","id":"https://mikelors.com/subscribe/","title":"Subscribe"}},"docInfo":{"https://mikelors.com/":{"body":51,"title":2},"https://mikelors.com/aboutMe/":{"body":481,"title":0},"https://mikelors.com/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://mikelors.com/posts/bilbostack25presentingtopic/":{"body":286,"title":7},"https://mikelors.com/posts/bookreviewaccelerate/":{"body":240,"title":9},"https://mikelors.com/posts/bookreviewblackbookoftheprogrammer/":{"body":214,"title":8},"https://mikelors.com/posts/bookreviewengineeringmanagementfortherestofus/":{"body":205,"title":7},"https://mikelors.com/posts/bookreviewremote/":{"body":295,"title":11},"https://mikelors.com/posts/bookreviewslack/":{"body":148,"title":5},"https://mikelors.com/posts/cleancodeapracticalapproach/":{"body":1254,"title":4},"https://mikelors.com/posts/howicreatedthisblog/":{"body":383,"title":6},"https://mikelors.com/posts/propertybasedtesting/":{"body":392,"title":8},"https://mikelors.com/subscribe/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":13},"lang":"English"};
